# common-solidity-reference-implementations

The aim of this repo is to gather solidity reference implementations, design patterns and gas optimization techniques for educational use as well as implementation references and research/practice purposes.

Disclaimer-: I am learning new patterns and techniques everyday but please do not take my work for face-value and implement as is. Make sure to do the due diligence and confirm all of my claims as I am still learning and improving everyday and it should not affect your project adversely.

This project contains the following reference/sample implementations -:

- Bitmaps [Storing boolean flags in a bitmap for gas optimization]
- MultiSig Wallet
- ERC20MerkleDistributor [Can be used to airdrop fixed amount of tokens to whitelisted accounts]
