# Sample Markle AirDrop/Distributor

Users can claim a defined amount of tokens once. The merkle tree leaf nodes are hashes of the account address. And the merkle proof is computed for the particular account when checking for merkle proof.

This project can be extended to include the amount of tokens to be dropped to a particular account as well. The leaf node for the merkle tree would then be the hash of the address and the amount and vis-a-vis for the merkle proof.
